According to the Renewable Energy Network REN21, nuclear provided 2.5% of the world’s energy used in 2015, compared to 1.4% provided by wind, solar, biomass and geothermal power sources combined. It’s clear that we need to scale up our renewable energy sources like wind and solar, but equally clear that to have any hope of weaning ourselves off fossil fuels (which provided around 80% of the energy we used in 2015), we need to use every low-carbon energy source we have."
